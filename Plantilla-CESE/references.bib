Today, it is considered as one of the most serious alternatives for IoT thanks to its low cost, low power consumption equipments and its open business model. LoRaWAN specifications proposes interesting solutions regarding Medium Access Control (MAC) layer operations to deliver the best communication performances to connected things. Despite its crucial impact on the overall performances, few researches consider the LoRaWAN MAC layer. This paper presents LoRaWAN MAC layer operations and services based on the LoRaWAN Alliance technical specifications. In addition, it proposes an overview of recent studies related to LoRaWAN performances and stands out the major challenges to be addressed in order to enhance the performance of data exchanges."

In conjunction with the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) market, low power wide area networks (LPWAN) have become a popular low-rate long-range radio communication technology. Sigfox, LoRa, and NB-IoT are the three leading LPWAN technologies that compete for large-scale IoT deployment. This paper provides a comprehensive and comparative study of these technologies, which serve as efficient solutions to connect smart, autonomous, and heterogeneous devices. We show that Sigfox and LoRa are advantageous in terms of battery lifetime, capacity, and cost. Meanwhile, NB-IoT offers benefits in terms of latency and quality of service. In addition, we analyze the IoT success factors of these LPWAN technologies, and we consider application scenarios and explain which technology is the best fit for each of these scenarios."

abstract = {The aim of this study is to shed light on the new LoRaTM protocol, one of the many technologies that is presented as the definitive solution to cover the increasing needs of the Low Power Wide Area Networks created to extend the Internet of Things everywhere and to everybody. The next document describes the main characteristics of this new technology, explaining the PHY layer LoRaTM as well as the MAC layer LoRaWANTM . Even so, its characteristics and many of its applications are very broad and many of them are still under development and still to come, that's why it has been impossible to explain all its functions, for example the use of LoRaTM for the geolocation. For this propose, we have divided the document on two main parts, on the first one, we explain LoRaTM protocol main features and some of their limitations due to the Duty Cycle regulation on the ISM band or due to the use of Aloha as Medium Acces Control. On the second part, we focus on the LoRaTM performance on real scenarios to check some of its principal features. Check the differences between Spreading Factors on long distances, compare the performance of the Cyclic Redundancy Checks against the Spreading Factor or evaluate how the free-licensed ISM band can affect the efficiency of the transmissions.},

abstract = {In this paper, physical limitations on bandwidth, realized gain, Q-factor and directivity are derived for antennas of arbitrary shape. The product of bandwidth and realizable gain is shown to be bounded from above by the eigenvalues of the long-wavelength, high-contrast polarizability dyadics. These dyadics are proportional to the antenna volume and are easily determined for an arbitrary geometry. Ellipsoidal antenna volumes are analysed in detail, and numerical results for some generic geometries are presented. The theory is verified against the classical Chu limitations for spherical geometries and shown to yield sharper bounds for the ratio of the directivity and the Q-factor for non-spherical geometries.},
